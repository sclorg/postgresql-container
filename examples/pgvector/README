Store your vectors with the rest of your data. Supports:

    exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
    single-precision, half-precision, binary, and sparse vectors
    L2 distance, inner product, cosine distance, L1 distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard distance
    any language with a Postgres client


Bind-mount this directory under /opt/app-root/src in the container, and all the
*.conf files from postgresql-cfg/ files will be included to postgresql.conf.

This config file enables the pgvector extensions that is available in the container
image, but needs to be enabled.
